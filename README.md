# Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Machine Learning, Logistic Regression)

### About Dataset
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data
   
Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.
   n the 3-dimensional space is that described in: [K. P. Bennett and O. L. Mangasarian: "Robust Linear Programming Discrimination of Two Linearly Inseparable Sets", Optimization Methods and Software 1, 1992, 23-34].

   This database is also available through the UW CS ftp server:

   ### Description:
   In this project, Logistic Regression has been used to predict whether a person has presence of breast cancer based on physical features of cell nucleus of that person.
